This repository contains the code used in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09904), which describes a method for learning a generative hydrological model.

The Web Applications demonstrating the applications of the generative hydrological models can be found in the following links:
1. Generating modeling use low-dimensional latent variable for generating hydrological predictions: https://generative-hydrological-prediction.streamlit.app/
2. Search the optimal latent variable value of generative model -- hydrological model calibration: https://generative-hydrological-calibration.streamlit.app/.
